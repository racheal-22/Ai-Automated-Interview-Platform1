# AI Automated Interview Platform

## Overview
The **AI Automated Interview Platform** is an innovative solution designed to simulate technical interviews for job candidates. The platform leverages artificial intelligence to assess candidates' responses, evaluate their coding skills, and provide real-time feedback. It includes multiple components to facilitate a fully automated interview experience:

- **AI Interview Agent**: The main system that simulates the interview process by asking questions.
- **Code Evaluation System**: Evaluates the code submitted by the candidate for correctness, efficiency, and performance.
- **Answer Evaluation System**: Analyzes the candidate's spoken or written answers to assess their problem-solving and communication skills.
- **Interviewer**: A virtual interviewer that asks questions and interacts with the candidate.

The platform aims to enhance the interview process, making it more efficient and scalable, especially in tech recruitment.

## Features
- **Real-Time Code Evaluation**: Evaluate coding problems on various difficulty levels, from basic algorithms to complex system design questions.
- **Voice-Based Interaction**: Candidates can answer questions using their voice, and the system evaluates both technical and communication skills.
- **Adaptive Questioning**: Based on the candidateâ€™s responses, the AI adapts and asks follow-up questions to dig deeper into their knowledge.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant feedback on both technical skills (code correctness) and soft skills (communication).

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Backend**: Python (for AI-driven functionalities)
- **Database**: MySQL or MongoDB (for storing candidate data, past interviews, etc.)
- **AI**: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for evaluating answers and Machine Learning models for adapting the interview questions.
- **Code Evaluation**: Use of sandboxed environments to evaluate code submissions.
